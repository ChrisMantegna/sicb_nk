Assessment and Method Recommendations:
1. Presence/Absence Data Trends:
    * Notable increases or decreases in organism counts.
    * Organisms unique to one year indicate potential changes in habitat or sampling methods.
2. Zone-Specific Observations:
    * Which zones have the highest biodiversity or variability.
    * Focus efforts on under-sampled or less diverse zones.
3. Survey Methodology Enhancements:
    * Shift from simple inventory to a quantitative assessment:
        * Stratified Random Sampling: Ensure even coverage across zones.
        * Time-Restricted Searches: Standardize effort across replicates.
    * Track environmental parameters: temperature, substrate type, etc.
4. Data Collection and Analysis Enhancements:
    * Use a standardized organism identification protocol to minimize inconsistencies.
    * Record additional metadata (e.g., weather, tide levels).
5. Hypothesis-Driven Monitoring:
    * Investigate why some organisms are increasing or decreasing.
    * Test the impact of environmental changes on species distribution.
